              description: Superset enforces approved authorizations for controlling information flow using a combination of role-based access controls (RBAC), network security groups, and web application firewall (WAF) configurations. RBAC restricts data access and dashboard visibility based on user roles (ReadOnly, WriteData, Admin) with least privilege principles. Network security is implemented through segmented VPC architecture, security groups limiting traffic between components (ECS tasks, load balancers, databases, Redis cache), and TLS encryption for all data in transit. The WAF protects against malicious requests with rate limiting, request filtering, and blocking unauthorized hosts. Google OAuth integration ensures authenticated access, while secure session management (with SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE, SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY, SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE) prevents session-based attacks. All actions are logged for auditing and monitoring purposes.
